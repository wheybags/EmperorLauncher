# How to play
Just run EmperorLauncher.exe, and the app will prompt you to insert or mount
your Emperor CDs. It will not work with an existing install, the app will 
create its own install folder from the CDs. Only works with the English
version of Emperor.

## How to play multiplayer:
- One player must choose to host in the launcher
- Other players must enter the host's IP in the launcher
- You can use the button in the launcher to test connection, but only after
  the host has launched the game
- Click multiplayer in the main menu
- Choose any username (must not be the same as other players), and type 8
  random characters for a password
- Click login
- Click Custom
- Hosting player click Host, others can click refresh if they don't see
  the host's game
- Host chooses Deathmatch or Co-op Campaign
- All clients click Accept
- Host clicks Play

Don't click random buttons or change settings. I didn't make everything
work, only the bare minimum.
